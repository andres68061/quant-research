# Commodities Page Enhancement Summary

## 🎯 What Was Done

Enhanced the **Commodities & Metals Analytics** page with **7 new professional-grade analysis modules**, increasing analytical capabilities from 5 to **12 comprehensive analysis types**.

**Date:** February 3, 2026  
**Files Modified:** `frontend/src/pages/MetalsAnalytics.tsx`  
**Lines Added:** ~1,800 lines of production code  
**Time Investment:** 2 hours

---

## 📊 New Analysis Types (7 Added)

### **1. 📊 Log Returns Analysis**
**Why:** Foundation for signal generation and risk modeling

Compare log vs arithmetic returns with:
- Side-by-side time series
- Scatter plot analysis
- Statistical comparison
- Difference tracking

**Key Insight:** Log returns are time-additive and better for multi-period analysis

---

### **2. 💰 Cumulative Wealth (NAV)**
**Why:** What investors actually see in their accounts

Track actual dollar P&L with:
- Configurable initial investment
- NAV path over time
- Dollar-based performance metrics
- CAGR calculations

**Key Insight:** Shows real wealth creation, not just percentages

---

### **3. 📉 Drawdown Analysis**
**Why:** Critical downside risk metric

Understand capital preservation with:
- Drawdown time series
- Maximum drawdown statistics
- Recovery time analysis
- Underwater plot

**Key Insight:** Max drawdown often more important than volatility

---

### **4. 📊 Risk Metrics Dashboard**
**Why:** Comprehensive risk-adjusted performance

Goes beyond Sharpe ratio with **13 metrics**:
- Sharpe Ratio
- Sortino Ratio (downside only)
- Calmar Ratio (CAGR/MaxDD)
- VaR 95% & 99% (Value at Risk)
- CVaR 95% & 99% (Expected Shortfall)
- Skewness & Kurtosis
- And more...

**Key Insight:** Different metrics reveal different risk dimensions

---

### **5. 📈 Rolling Metrics**
**Why:** Time-varying risk and regime detection

Track metrics over time with:
- Rolling Sharpe ratio
- Rolling Sortino ratio
- Rolling volatility
- Rolling correlation (pairwise)
- Configurable window size

**Key Insight:** Risk is not constant - it changes over time

---

### **6. 📊 Return Distribution**
**Why:** Understand tail risk and normality

Analyze return characteristics with:
- Log vs Arithmetic histograms
- Q-Q plots (quantile-quantile)
- Jarque-Bera normality test
- Skewness and kurtosis

**Key Insight:** Returns are rarely normal - fat tails matter!

---

### **7. 📅 Multi-Period Performance**
**Why:** Quick performance summary across horizons

Compare performance across **8 time periods**:
- 1 Month, 3 Months, 6 Months
- YTD, 1 Year, 3 Years, 5 Years
- Since Inception

With color-coded tables and CAGR calculations

**Key Insight:** Consistency matters - look beyond recent returns

---

## 🎓 Educational Components

Each new section includes:
- 📘 Info boxes explaining concepts
- 📖 Expandable help sections
- 💡 Interpretation guides
- 🔍 Context and best practices

**Total educational content:** 5 major help sections with detailed explanations

---

## 🔥 Key Improvements

### **Follows Quant Best Practices:**

✅ **"Never report only one series"**
   - Before: Single view per metric
   - After: Multiple views (log + arithmetic + NAV)

✅ **Model with log returns**
   - Now available for signal generation

✅ **Report with geometric metrics**
   - CAGR, Calmar ratio, proper compounding

✅ **Always include drawdown analysis**
   - Complete drawdown toolkit added

✅ **Multiple risk metrics**
   - Expanded from 1 to 13 metrics

---

## 📈 Metrics Comparison

| Metric Category | Before | After | Increase |
|----------------|--------|-------|----------|
| Analysis Types | 5 | 12 | **+140%** |
| Risk Metrics | 1 | 13 | **+1,200%** |
| Chart Types | ~8 | ~28 | **+250%** |
| Return Views | 1 | 5 | **+400%** |

---

## 💻 Technical Highlights

### **Proper Calculations:**

**CAGR (Geometric Mean):**
```python
cagr = ((final_value / initial_value) ** (1 / years) - 1)
```

**Sortino Ratio (Downside Risk Only):**
```python
downside_returns = returns[returns < 0]
downside_std = downside_returns.std()
sortino = (mean_return / downside_std) * sqrt(periods_per_year)
```

**Drawdown:**
```python
cum_returns = (1 + returns).cumprod()
running_max = cum_returns.expanding().max()
drawdown = (cum_returns - running_max) / running_max
```

**Value at Risk (VaR):**
```python
var_95 = np.percentile(returns, 5)  # 5th percentile
```

**Conditional VaR (Expected Shortfall):**
```python
cvar_95 = returns[returns <= var_95].mean()  # Average of tail
```
