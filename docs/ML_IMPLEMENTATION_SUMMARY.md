# ML Price Prediction Feature - Implementation Summary

**Date:** February 3, 2026  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Feature:** Machine Learning price direction prediction for commodities

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Core Modules

#### `src/data/ml_features.py` (600+ lines)
**Purpose:** Feature engineering for ML models

**Key Functions:**
- `create_ml_features()`: Creates 15+ lagged features (returns, volatility, downside deviation, RSI, MA distance, seasonality)
- `create_ml_features_with_transparency()`: Wrapper that adds full transparency reporting
- `check_outliers()`: Reports outliers without removing them
- `check_class_imbalance()`: Analyzes up/down day distribution
- `prepare_ml_dataset()`: Batch processing for multiple commodities

**Design Decisions:**
- ✅ Log returns (time-additive, better for ML)
- ✅ Mix of expanding (baseline) and rolling (regime) metrics
- ✅ All features lagged (no look-ahead bias)
- ✅ Forward fill missing data (commodities trade continuously)
- ❌ No outlier removal (transparent reporting only)
- ❌ No scaling for XGBoost (tree-based)

#### `src/models/commodity_direction.py` (800+ lines)
**Purpose:** ML models and walk-forward validation

**Key Classes:**
- `WalkForwardValidator`: Expanding window validation
- `XGBoostDirectionModel`: Tree-based classifier
- `LSTMDirectionModel`: Neural network with StandardScaler

**Key Functions:**
- `run_walk_forward_validation()`: Single model validation
- `compare_models()`: XGBoost vs LSTM comparison
- `evaluate_model_performance()`: Comprehensive metrics

**Features:**
- ✅ Walk-forward with expanding window
- ✅ Auto-detects class imbalance (applies class_weight if >65%)
- ✅ Comprehensive metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC AUC)
- ✅ Feature importance (XGBoost)
- ✅ Early stopping (LSTM)

#### `apps/pages/2_📊_Metals_Analytics.py` (Updated)
**Purpose:** Streamlit integration

**New Section:** "ML Price Prediction" (14th analysis type)

**Features:**

## Technical Highlights

### Feature Engineering
```python
# 15+ features created:
- log_return_1d, 5d, 21d, 63d          # Recent returns
- vol_21d, 63d                          # Volatility regime
- downside_dev_expanding                # Long-term baseline
- downside_dev_21d, 63d                 # Recent downside risk
- rsi_14d                               # Momentum
- distance_from_ma_50, 200              # Mean reversion
- month, quarter                        # Seasonality
```

### Walk-Forward Validation
```python
# Expanding window example:
Split 1: Train[days 0:63]   → Test[days 63:68]
Split 2: Train[days 0:68]   → Test[days 68:73]   # Expanding
Split 3: Train[days 0:73]   → Test[days 73:78]   # Expanding
...
```

### Models
```python
# XGBoost
- n_estimators=100
- max_depth=3 (shallow to prevent overfitting)
- Auto class_weight if >65% imbalance

# LSTM
- sequence_length=60
- hidden_units=64
- dropout_rate=0.3
- StandardScaler (fit on train only)
- Early stopping (patience=10)
```

## What Makes This Different

### 1. Transparency First
Most ML implementations are black boxes. This implementation:
- ✅ Explicitly documents every data prep decision
- ✅ Reports what was NOT done (as important as what was done)
- ✅ Defers decisions to user (outlier treatment, hyperparameter tuning)
- ✅ Educational focus (teaches best practices)

### 2. No Look-Ahead Bias
- ✅ All features properly lagged
- ✅ Scaler fit on train only (not whole dataset)
- ✅ Walk-forward validation (no peeking at future)
- ✅ Expanding window (realistic)

### 3. Keeps Outliers
- ✅ Reports outliers transparently
- ✅ Provides interpretation (real event vs data error?)
- ✅ User decides on treatment (cap/winsorize/keep)
- ❌ Does NOT auto-remove (many implementations do this silently)

### 4. Mix of Expanding and Rolling
- ✅ Expanding metrics: Long-term baseline (e.g., downside_dev_expanding)
- ✅ Rolling metrics: Recent regime (e.g., vol_21d, downside_dev_21d)
- ✅ Best of both worlds

## Design Philosophy

This implementation follows these principles:

1. **Transparency over black boxes**
   - Explicit about what we did and didn't do
   - User decisions clearly marked
   - Educational focus

2. **Correctness over convenience**
   - No look-ahead bias (even if it means more code)
   - Proper validation (walk-forward, not simple train/test split)
   - All features lagged

3. **Flexibility over assumptions**
   - Keep outliers (report, let user decide)
   - Mix of expanding and rolling (capture both contexts)
   - Multiple models (compare, don't assume best)

4. **Education over production**
   - Detailed documentation
   - Interpretation guides
   - Code examples
   - FAQ sections

## Conclusion

✅ **Complete implementation** of ML price direction prediction for commodities

✅ **Full transparency** on data preparation and modeling decisions

✅ **Comprehensive documentation** (3,000+ lines across 4 files)

✅ **No linter errors** in new code

✅ **Ready to use** (after installing xgboost and tensorflow)

**Key Takeaway:** This is a **transparent, educational implementation** that explicitly documents all design decisions, allowing users to understand and modify the approach for their own research.
