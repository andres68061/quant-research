# Streamlit Transparency Display - Summary

**Location:** `apps/pages/2_📊_Metals_Analytics.py` → "ML Price Prediction"  
**Status:** ✅ Complete transparency display implemented

## What's Shown in the Streamlit App

### 1. Data Preparation Transparency Section
**Location:** Displayed immediately after features are created (before model training)  
**Display:** Expandable section (expanded by default)

#### ✅ What We DID (7 items)
Shown in the app:
1. Forward filled missing data
2. Created log returns (not arithmetic)
3. Mixed expanding and rolling windows
4. All features lagged (no look-ahead)
5. Dropped rows with NaN in features
6. StandardScaler for LSTM only
7. Auto-balanced class weights

#### ❌ What We DID NOT Do (6 items)
Shown in the app:
1. NO outlier removal/capping
2. NO PCA or dimensionality reduction
3. NO Box-Cox transforms
4. NO synthetic data (SMOTE)
5. NO hyperparameter tuning
6. NO ensemble methods

#### ⚠️ To Be Decided (5 items)
Shown in the app:
1. Outlier treatment: Keep / Cap / Winsorize
2. Hyperparameter tuning: Use defaults or optimize?
3. Additional features: Ratios, cross-asset, more indicators?
4. Model selection: Try LightGBM, CatBoost, Transformers?

## Screenshots Guide (What User Will See)

### Section 1: Initial Transparency (Top of Results)
```
✅ Features created: 1234 rows, 15 features

📋 Data Preparation Transparency  [expanded]

### What We Did

#### ✅ Completed:                  #### ❌ NOT Done:
- ✓ Forward filled missing data    - ✗ NO outlier removal/capping
- ✓ Created log returns...          - ✗ NO PCA or dimensionality...
- ✓ Mixed expanding and rolling...  - ✗ NO Box-Cox transforms
- ✓ All features lagged...          - ✗ NO synthetic data (SMOTE)
- ✓ Dropped rows with NaN...        - ✗ NO hyperparameter tuning
                                     - ✗ NO ensemble methods

#### ⚠️ To Be Decided:
- ? Outlier treatment: Keep / Cap / Winsorize
- ? Hyperparameter tuning: Use defaults or optimize?
- ? Additional features: Ratios, cross-asset, more indicators?
- ? Model selection: Try LightGBM, CatBoost, Transformers?
- ? Class imbalance strategy: Adjust threshold or oversample?

### 🔍 Outlier Analysis

[Total Returns]  [Outliers (>3σ)]  [Min Return]  [Max Return]
    1234             15 (1.22%)      -8.45%        +7.23%

ℹ️ Interpretation: Low outlier count (<1%) - likely real price 
   movements. Keep all data.
   
   Action Taken: NONE - All data kept. User can decide on 
   capping/winsorizing later.

### ⚖️ Class Distribution (Up vs Down Days)

[Down Days (0)]          [Up Days (1)]
612 (49.6%)             622 (50.4%)

✅ No class weighting needed (balanced)

### 🔍 Data Preparation Transparency

#### ✅ What We DID:

1. Forward filled missing data
   - Commodities trade continuously
   - Gaps are typically weekends/holidays

2. Used LOG returns (not arithmetic)
   - Time-additive: log(P_t / P_{t-1})
   - Better for ML and time-series
   - More symmetric distribution

[... continues with 7 items, each with explanation ...]

#### ❌ What We DID NOT Do:

1. NO outlier removal/capping
   - All data kept (including extreme returns)
   - We REPORT outliers but don't remove them
   - You decide: Keep / Cap / Winsorize

[... continues with 6 items, each with reason ...]

#### ⚠️ To Be DECIDED (By You):

1. Outlier Treatment
   - Check outlier report above
   - Options: Keep all / Cap at 3σ / Winsorize 1%/99%
   - Current: Keeping all (transparent)

[... continues with 5 items, each with options ...]

### ⚠️ Important Disclaimers

⚠️ This is Educational/Research Code:

- ❌ Not production-ready for live trading
- ❌ No transaction costs included
- ❌ No slippage modeling
- ❌ No position sizing or risk management

   - Can review before waiting for training

2. **User reviews transparency**
   - Understands what was done
   - Sees what was NOT done (just as important)
   - Knows what decisions are deferred

3. **User sees outlier analysis**
   - Actual counts and percentages
   - Interpretation provided
   - **Action taken explicitly stated**

4. **User sees results**
   - Model metrics displayed
   - Can click interpretation guide for more detail

5. **User reads interpretation guide**
   - Reinforces transparency

## Summary

**Transparency is now:**
- ✅ Prominent (shown first, expanded by default)
- ✅ Comprehensive (7 did + 6 didn't + 5 to decide)
- ✅ Explicit (especially about outliers: "NONE - All data kept")
- ✅ Actionable (provides options for user decisions)
- ✅ Educational (explains why, not just what)
- ✅ Honest (clear disclaimers and warnings)
- ✅ Accessible (in app + documentation)

**The user will NEVER miss:**
- What data prep was done
- What was skipped (and why)
- That outliers are kept (not removed)
- What decisions are theirs to make
- That this is educational code
